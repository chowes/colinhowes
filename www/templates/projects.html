<h3>Alternative Data Collection</h3>

<p class="page-text">
    The Alternative Data Collection project is focused around improving data collection methods through gamification (you can read more about it <a href="#/research">here</a>). I am part of a team of graduate and undergraduate students involved in developing and deploying a gamified public health data collection tool. I am responsible for building and maintaining survey database management tools. I am also working on an interactive tool using the R Shiny framework that will allow users to dynamically view data as they progress through our survey.

<h3>Data Cleaning and Analysis</h3>

<p class="page-text">
   I have developed a set of data analysis tools in Python and R that automate standard data cleaning procedures in our lab. Manual manipulation of raw data is a concern in terms of both researcher bias and human error. This set of tools handles data consistently across experimental groups according to a pre-specified set of criteria, ensuring that all data is handled in the same way, according to the same set of standards.

<h3>NES Controlled PICAXE Robot</h3>

<p class="page-text">
    I created a small robot capable of autonomous roaming and obstacle avoidance, with support for user input via an NES controller. This simple project sparked my interest in low level programming, and contributed to my understanding of computer architecture and organization.
