    I am a graduate student in the University of Guelph's Neuroscience and Applied Cognitive Science MSc program. My current research is based around investigating the role of sex hormones in learning, memory, and social behaviour. I'm also involved in a project through the School of Computer Science that is focused on developing novel methods of enhancing public health data collection by making surveys more engaging and rewarding.

    I am interested in the intersections between computer science and the natural sciences. As a neuroscience researcher, I find myself drawn to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. Outside of the lab, I am a competitive sport fencer and avid cyclist.
